 [Ornamental Gamma Spectrometer with LED-Illumination]

    This work woll display the gamma beam detection visually and am the suggestion of the interior/ornamental light letting you feel normal as healing.

NaI scintillator and a photomultiplier tube detect the gamma beam. The full color LED emits light with the hue mapping to the energy level for the detection with more than of given energy. GR-SAKURA measures the detection puls from a photomultiplier tube through a pulse width extension circuit and controls LED illumination (Serial Full Color LED).While the given energy level will be adjusted with detecting a time par some minutes, because low level gamma rays are much in the nature.
